Just wrapped up a Power BI project based on sales data, and I wanted to share a bit about it.

I worked on building a sales dashboard that gives a clear picture of how the business is performing — tracking things like total revenue, top-selling products, sales by region, and monthly trends.

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

Cleaning and shaping data in Power Query

Creating relationships between different tables

Writing DAX measures to calculate key metrics

Designing a dashboard that’s not just functional but also easy to navigate

One thing I really enjoyed was seeing how raw data can be turned into insights that actually help in decision-making. There’s something satisfying about watching numbers turn into a story.

Still learning, still improving — but happy with how this one turned out.
